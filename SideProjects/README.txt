Directory "WebCamForceSettings/SideProjects" used for side projects in main project WebCamForceSettings.
Any side project is not required to download and build: the application WebCamForceSettings can work without any of the side projects.
The side project must be placed in the directory "WebCamForceSettings/SideProjects".
Any placed side project is considered usable and will be used when building the main project.
In order not to use a placed side project, when building the main project, see the section "Defines for side projects".
